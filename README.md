Hi, I am Michael Parham. I live in Austin, Texas and work for Maximus Inc. as a Software Engineer.
I have been programming since 1983 with my rfirst computer, Commodore Vic-20, then Commodore 64,
Amiga 1000, Amiga 3000 and then moved into the PC line. I once sold Commodore computers at 
Bergstrom Airforce Base. I been through programming languages such as Basic, COBOL, Fortran,
Pascal, Assembly, Visual Basic and C#. I am now moving into the next era of using tools like
Co Pilot and enjoying the new AI revolution. I wouldn't mind working with others on learning
more about using these tools and maybe picking up a few more languages like Python.

My other interest are videos, photosgraphy and I used to fly but have not done that ina  while.
I have a home media server using Plex with almost 4000 movies just over 200 TV series.
